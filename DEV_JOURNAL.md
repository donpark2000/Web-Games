# Dev journal

A running record of decisions, findings, and open questions, newest at the
bottom. Findings record **evidence**: what was tested, what was observed,
and what it does and doesn't prove.

## Open questions

- **Q1. Playing each other on separate devices.** *Raised 2026-10-04
  (entry "Kickoff decisions").* The developer: "it might be cool" for the
  kids to play each other in the same game on their own devices, but not
  the most important feature. GitHub Pages only serves files; it can't
  pass moves between two devices. It needs a go-between: a service we run,
  or a free outside one (e.g. a WebRTC signalling service), plus a "join
  code" step for the kids. An outside service conflicts with "nothing
  loaded from other sites" (`DESIGN.md`). Parked as a later phase; the
  tic-tac-toe rules are to be written so it can be added without
  rewriting them. **Parking confirmed** (developer, 2026-10-04); stays
  open as a later phase.

## Resolved

- **Q2. Licence.** *Raised 2026-10-04.* The repo was public with no
  licence. **Resolved 2026-10-04:** GPL-3.0, same as GP-200 Patch Manager
  Web (developer: "gpl 3 is fine"). `LICENSE` copied from that repo
  (the standard GPL-3.0 text, 674 lines).

## 2026-10-04: Kickoff decisions

The session started in the GP-200 Patch Manager Web repo by mistake; it
was moved to this folder (`C:\Users\dpark\Documents\Web-Games`, empty,
made that morning). Nothing in the GP-200 repo was changed.

**The developer's idea:** simple web games for their grandkids, a
tic-tac-toe game and a "find matching cards" game, both reached from the
same home page.

**Answers to the kickoff questions** (developer, 2026-10-04):
- Ages: **5-7** (early readers).
- Devices: **tablet (iPad/Android) and phone**.
- Tic-tac-toe: **two players on one device** and **against the
  computer**; playing each other on their own devices would be nice but
  isn't the most important feature (Q1).
- Repo: **public, hosted on GitHub Pages**, like GP-200 Patch Manager
  Web.

**Proposed by Claude, not objected to** (recorded in `DESIGN.md`; open to
change when the developer gives more details):
- Same setup as GP-200 Patch Manager Web: plain JavaScript, no build
  step, rules in `src/core/` tested under Node, a `?dev` debug log, and
  the same project files. Reason: the developer already knows this way of
  working, and it fits a small static site.
- Nothing loaded from other sites; no ads, tracking or sign-in.
- Tic-tac-toe computer: an easy setting that makes mistakes on purpose,
  and a harder one.
- Matching cards: single player, emoji pictures (no licensing), 6/8/10
  pairs, a move counter, no timer.
- Sound effects with a mute button, off by default until the developer
  has heard them.

**Repo set up** (developer's OK, 2026-10-04): `git init` here, public
repo `donpark2000/Web-Games` created and pushed. GitHub Pages not turned
on yet; that is the publish step, done with the developer's OK.

**Next:** the developer gives more details before building starts.

## 2026-10-04: Licence; separate-device play stays parked

The developer: GPL-3.0 is fine (Q2 resolved; `LICENSE` added, README and
`DESIGN.md` say so), and parking play on separate devices is fine (Q1
stays open as a later phase).

## 2026-10-04: Tic-tac-toe: the developer's details; mockup v1

**The developer's details** (2026-10-04), before any building:
- **Avatars instead of X and O:** each player picks a cartoon-like face
  (people or animals) from a list; the face fills each square they take.
- **Win:** no line through the winning squares. The squares that didn't
  win are blurred out (both players'), and the 3 winning squares are
  highlighted.
- **Against the computer:** its avatar is preselected, a little robot
  face.
- **Setup ("new game") screen:** choose "Player vs Computer" or "Two
  players", or maybe just pick two avatars, where picking the robot means
  a one-player game (the developer left this open).
- **Who goes first** is chosen on the setup screen: take turns each
  round, winner goes first, or loser goes first.
- **Game screen controls:** "New game" (back to the setup screen) and
  "Play again" (same avatars, the grid clears).
- **Scorecard below the grid:** games won per avatar; starts at 0-0 on a
  new game.
- **The computer must be beatable:** "not too aggressive".
- Review screen mockups before building.

**Mockup v1** (private Claude artifact, throwaway; nothing in the repo),
clickable on a phone-width page. It shows both setup ideas for the
developer to compare: **A** "Who's playing?" first (Me and the robot / Two
players; the robot is preselected), and **B** just two face pickers, the
robot first in Player 2's list. Claude's proposals in it, for review:
- 18 emoji faces (14 animals, girl, boy, grandma, grandpa); the robot
  only for the computer. A face the other player has is greyed out.
- Each player's squares are tinted their colour (orange / blue), so two
  similar faces still read apart.
- "<face>'s turn" above the grid; the scorecard also outlines whose turn
  it is. A tie gets a "Ties" count between the two scores.
- The robot waits 0.8 s ("is thinking..."), takes a win 75% of the time,
  blocks 55%, likes the centre, otherwise plays at random. One level.
- After a tie, the other player starts the next round (all three
  first-player rules). The first round: player 1 (the child, against the
  robot).
- "Play again" mid-round restarts the round without scoring it; "New
  game" keeps the last picks on the setup screen; scores reset on Play.
